# Foundations in Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

## Installing and Setup of SLM
Sometimes just setting up the tools and going through installation is difficult. Of course, this is important; it enables proper learning of the materials. Form is important, first. Hence, the system architecture that developers contribute on are very important to how frameworks, packages, and tools are used and executed. So, unless otherwise specified, these notes will be from the perspective of a software developer on a macOS system. 

With that being said, I had a number of issues with just trying to install the SLM library:

```
brew doctor
brew link node
rm '/usr/local/bin/node'
```
