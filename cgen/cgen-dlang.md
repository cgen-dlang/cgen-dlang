The main document on the Community Generated Design Language Framework and Application

## Introduction
The Community Generated Design Language (cgen-dlang, dlang, cgen, CD) is a collaborative design framework developed for small and diverse communities (5 -10 people) who wish to design continually evolving, inclusive, equitable products. Resulting products (or structures) are a product of individually submitted designs and collective decision making. Collective decision making is supported by both the human participants and the evolutionary approach of the cgen framework. To demonstrate, build on, and test the framework, we create personas that, through cgen, engage in a community learning space's evolutionary and equitable design. Our results show that creating design products through the cgen framework is possible despite variance in expertise, ability, and role.

## Design of The Community Generated Design Language

### The Beginning
Before we begin with expressing the planning, form, and function of cgen, we must admit that the foundations of cgen are rooted in mathematical linguistics, neurobiology, deep reinforcement learning, cultural evolution (cognitive science), and communication theory (information theory). The intent behind cgen is to create an intelligent design thinking and research framework, application, and platform. 

As a team of designers, developers, and scientist we believed that such a multidimensional system should be language-agnostic and implementable with any standard programming language like python or R. Further, the need to design a framework first is to make sure that we could explore both the top-down and bottom up approaches of an AGI system. Then, leverage their drawbacks and potentials.

### The Magic
The magic of cgen is not necessarily the machine learning or evolutionary algorithms that underpin the generation of novel products from the input of community participants, but the harmony and collaboration between the human participants and the cgen system. For cgen to be magical, humans must coordinate both the imaginations of humans and artificially intelligent systems.

### The Field
As students of cognitive science, we view the field of AI on a continuum: 

1. On one end --- symbolic systems
2. On one end --- connectionism

The difference between these approaches give rise to various conceptual bridges and perspectives. So, we tread carefully and, with great admiration, consider the limits and assumptions of these perspectives and the bridges between them. With that being said, as the humans behind the cgen project we are also biased in that we want the most straightforward answer to the question:

_What is the fundamental unit or minimal architecture that gives rise to learning and thus creativity and intelligence in agents of man, machine, animal, plant, and culture._
